# Welcome to .NET

## What is .NET?
- .NET is an open source developer platform created by Microsoft. It's for building many different types of apps, such as web apps, desktop apps, games, api, smart phones apps....
- In short, .NET Platform is a collection of **languages**, **libraries**, and **frameworks** to make various applications, developed under one common standard.
- With .Net platform you can build your app, test app, deploy the app and maintain. This is why .Net caters mostly all phases of SDLC.

## Supported Programming Languages
- Dozens of programming languages are supported by .Net provided they are compatible with the platform. [List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CLI_languages)
- 3 different languages which are by default supported by .Net are
- C#: Object oriented, type safe language
    - object oriented means, that everything is an object. These objects are further organized with classes
    - Type-safe means that once you declare a type of a variable, you can't really change it. 
- Visual Basic : Supports UI and component oriented language.
- F#: F# is a functional programming language supported by .NET
- All .Net compliant languages ahve to follow a Standard. These standard are defined by CLS (Common Language Specification).
  - CLS gives a set of rules and regulation a .Net compliant language should follow. Ex all .Net compliant languages should be OOP languages, Array index should start from 0 etc...

## Technologies we'll be using during this training
- .NET 6 
- C#
- VB.Net

## [History of .Net](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/versioning-sdk-msbuild-vs)
- Microsoft introduced .Net 1.0 (deprecated) in 2002. It was known as .Net Framework
  
## .NET Implementation
4 main implementation of .NET 
- **.NET Framework**: first implementation of .NET, only works on windows, and it is shipped with every windows.
- **.NET / .NET Core**: .NET Core is the cross-platform implemtation of .NET, and is a successor of .NET Framework. 
    - This is a primary implementation of .NET and is the focus of ongoing development effort. This what we'll be using.
    -.NET 6
- **Mono**
    - .NET runtime that power Xamarin application. 
    - useful when small footprint is needed
    - also powers games built with Unity
- **Universal Windows Platform (UWP)**
    - Used for building modern, touch-enabled Windows applications and software for the Internet of Things (IoT). 
    - It's designed to unify the different types of devices that you may want to target, including PCs, tablets, phones, and even the Xbox.

## Components of .NET Implementation
- One or more runtime: Example, .NET Framework CLR, .NET 5 CLR
     - [CLR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/clr) stands for *Common Language Runtime* and it's a runtime environment provided by .NET.
     - Compilers and tools expose the common language runtime's functionality and enable you to write code that benefits from this [managed execution environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/managed-execution-process).
- A class library, for example, .NET Framework Base Class Library, or .NET 5 Base Class Library.
- Optionally, we have one or more application frameworks, such as ASP.NET Core for web application development, Windows Forms, etc.
- Optionally, development tools. Some are shared among multiple implementations.

#### CLR? SDK?
- CLR Stands for Common Language Runtime, and it's runtime environment. It is also know as main execution Engine and is used to run any .Net application.
- SDK stands for Software Development Kit.
- CLR comes included in SDK

## .NET Standard
- .NET Standard is a base set of API's that are common to all .NET implementation.

### Additional Frameworks
These are frameworks that extend .NET platform to provide additional functionalities.
- **ASP.NET Core**: Open source framework for building web apps and web services
    - it's a redesign on ASP.NET 4.x with architectural changes that result in a lener, more modular framework
- **Unity**: Real-time 3D development platform
- **UWP (Universal Windows Platform)**: for developing various windows applications
- **Xamarin**: for mobile development
- **ML.NET**: machine learning
- and more..
## Types of Applications
- CUI (Character User Interface) - command line interface. Ex console app in .Net
- GUI (with user friendly UI) - Desktop app, web apps
- Smart UIs - Android or IOS
- APIs - REST Api
- Cloud application : Azure, GCP, AWS
### Other Niceties..
- **Nuget**: a package manager for .NET

### Anatomy of C# code
```
Namespace
    Types (class, structs, enums, delegates, interface)
        Type members (variables, methods, events)
```

## [Namespaces](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/namespaces/using-namespaces)
- They organize large code projects.
- They're delimited by using the . operator.
- The using directive obviates the requirement to specify the name of the namespace for every class.
- The global namespace is the "root" namespace: global::System will always refer to the .NET System namespace.
